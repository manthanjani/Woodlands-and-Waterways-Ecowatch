Aquatic ecosystems are vital for maintaining biodiversity and ensuring sustainable water resource management. Healthy ecosystems not only support a wide variety of species but also play a crucial role in maintaining water quality, benefiting both natural habitats and human communities. A key measure of aquatic ecosystem health is the composition and diversity of benthic macro invertebrates small organisms living at the bottom of water bodies. These organisms act as sensitive bio indicators, reflecting changes in environmental conditions caused by both natural processes and human activities.
This project focuses on exploring the roles played by benthic macro invertebrates in their ecosystems and assessing the health of aquatic habitats in lakes across Halliburton County. It examines ecological indicators such as species diversity and community composition using data collected over the past five years. By analyzing various site characteristics including water quality, depth, elevation, and location the study aims to understand how these factors influence the diversity and health of benthic communities.
The primary objective of this work is to develop predictive models that anticipate changes in benthic macro invertebrate communities over time. These models leverage key environmental parameters, such as elevation (how high a site is above sea level), drawdown (water level fluctuations), and headwater status (whether a site is located at the origin of a river or stream). A significant aspect of this research involves analyzing the biological responses of these organisms to water chemistry changes, such as variations in pH, dissolved oxygen, and nutrient levels. This analysis will provide insights into how ecosystems might shift in response to environmental changes, supporting proactive management strategies.
Our methodology combines statistical analyses with advanced machine learning techniques to uncover patterns and relationships between environmental factors and benthic community composition. Starting with exploratory data analysis, we aim to identify key variables and gain a clear understanding of the dataset. This is followed by assessments of functional diversity, focusing on the roles species play in maintaining ecosystem health. Finally, sophisticated forecasting models will be developed to predict future changes in community structures, offering valuable tools for lake management and conservation.
Through this research, we aim to assist decision-makers in Halliburton County by providing evidence-based insights into Lake Ecosystem dynamics. Understanding how lakes respond to short-term disturbances and long-term environmental changes will enable conservation organizations and local authorities to make informed decisions. By preserving ecological integrity, this project supports sustainable environmental management and helps safeguard these aquatic ecosystems for future generations.
